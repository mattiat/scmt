deficiency (gene deletion or deletion mutation, sign: Δ): mutation (genetic aberration) in which a part of a chromosome is missing.

Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD): mRNA surveillance that detects nonsense mutations and prevent the expression of erroneous proteins. Following transcription, precursor mRNA undergoes an assemblage of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) components followed by regulatory pre-mRNA processing. Large average intron size in eukaryotic cells greatly increases the probability that aberrant mRNA splicing will result in the presence of a nonsense (stop) codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) somewhere within the open reading frame.

allele: variant form of a gene. Two classification systems:
_Recessive/Dominant systems: 
    a recessive allele must be homozygous in order for the phenotype to be observed; weakness: an allele’s behavior depends on which other alleles are present
_Morphy
    Amorph (null) allele: deletion of enough of the gene so as to render it functionless.
    Hypomorph: increased gene function; normal protein product, but less of it. 
    Hypermorph: decreased gene function.
    Neomorph: new gene function; often caused by the fusion of two existing genes, creating a hybrid protein product.
    Antimorph: inhibits or interferes with the gene function of another allele (causing it to produce less gene product).
