splicing: modification of an RNA after transcription, in which introns are removed and exons are joined. This is needed for the typical eukaryotic messenger RNA before it can be used to produce a correct protein through translation.

intron: any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing to generate the final mature RNA product of a gene.

exon: a nucleic acid sequence that is represented in the mature form of an RNA molecule either after portions of a precursor RNA (introns) have been removed by cis-splicing or when two or more precursor RNA molecules have been ligated by trans-splicing.

UTR (UnTranslated Region): mRNA region that is not translated; can contain elements for controlling gene expression. 5'UTR and 3'UTR.

Confocal microscopy: optical imaging technique used to increase optical resolution and contrast of a micrograph; eliminates out-of-focus light; it enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from the obtained images.
