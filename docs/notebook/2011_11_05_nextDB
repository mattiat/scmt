EST (Expressed Sequence Tag): short sub-sequence of a cDNA sequence.

cDNA (complementary DNA): DNA synthesized from a messenger RNA (mRNA) template in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase (and DNA polymerase). cDNA is ready to be transcribed and expressed (no introns, no need for splicing!). Complementary DNA is often used in gene cloning or as gene probes.

in situ hybridization (ISH): a type of hybridization that uses a labeled complementary DNA or RNA strand (i.e., probe) to localize a specific DNA or RNA sequence in a portion or section of tissue (in situ). Fluorescent DNA ISH (FISH) can, for example, be used in medical diagnostics to assess chromosomal integrity.

hybridization: process of establishing a non-covalent, sequence-specific interaction between two or more complementary strands of nucleic acids into a single hybrid. DNA will bind to its complement under normal conditions, so two perfectly complementary strands will bind to each other readily. Most commonly, the pairs of nucleic bases A=T and Gâ‰¡C are formed, of which the latter is more stable.
