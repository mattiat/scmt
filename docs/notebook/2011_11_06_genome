_ first multicellular organism to have its genome completely sequenced (1998, completed by 2002).
_ sequenced using the "hierarchical" or clone-by-clone approach (as opposed to whole genome shotgun)
_ 100 Mb (100 megabases, 100 million base pairs)
_ gene density: 1 gene/5kb.
_ introns are 26%
_ 6 chromosomes (named I, II, II, IV, V and X) and a mitochondrion.
mitochondrion (plural mitochondria): membrane-enclosed organelle found in most eukaryotic cells; sometimes described as "cellular power plants" because they generate most of the cell's adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In addition, they are involved in signaling, cellular differentiation, cell death, cell cycle and cell growth.
_ 20,470 protein-coding genes.
_ 16,000 RNA genes, transcribed into non-coding RNA.
non-coding RNA (ncRNA, functional RNA fRNA): RNA molecule that is not translated into a protein. Variety of functions within the cell.
