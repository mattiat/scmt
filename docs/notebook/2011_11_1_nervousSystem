(nerve) process: a projection or outgrowth of tissue from a larger body.

neurite: any projection from the cell body of a neuron(either an axon or a dendrite)

dendrite (from Greek déndron, “tree”): neural input site; branched projection of a neuron that conduct the electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells into the soma.

axon: neural output.

soma (from Greek “body”): bulbous end of a neuron, containing the cell nucleus.

axon guidance (axon pathfinding): process by which neurons send out axons.

growth cone: dynamic extension of a developing axon seeking its synaptic target.

tropism (from Greek trope, "a turning"): growth or turning movement in response to an environmental stimulus (eg. phototropism in plants).

neural pathway: connection of one part of the nervous system with another; usually consists of white matter (bundles of elongated, myelin-insulated neurons). Serves to connect relatively distant areas of the nervous system, compared to the local communication of grey matter.

commissure: place where two things are joined. In anatomy, a bundle of nerve fibers that cross the midline at their level of origin or entry.
